In this analysis, we examined a dataset related to insurance claims, aiming to discern patterns and characteristics associated with fraud detection. The dataset comprises various features such as the month, day, and area of the accident, details about the vehicle and policyholder, and the claim's specifics. Initial exploration revealed a mixture of categorical and numerical variables, with some missing values present, which were subsequently filled with the mean of their respective columns. Categorical variables were transformed using one-hot encoding to prepare the data for analysis. Following preprocessing, the dataset was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Upon preprocessing, the dataset was subjected to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling to uncover insights and develop a fraud detection system. Through EDA, we visualized the distribution of accidents across different months, days, and areas, providing valuable context for understanding claim patterns. Additionally, we examined the relationship between various features and the likelihood of fraud detection. Moving forward, predictive modeling techniques were applied to develop a robust fraud detection system. Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed to assess the performance of the system, aiding in its refinement and optimization for real-world deployment.
